Exercise Sheet 8
================

A) False Sharing
----------------

Have a look at this git PR:
https://github.com/KhronosGroup/Vulkan-ValidationLayers/pull/5587

Explain the problem it tries to solve, and how it attempts to do so.


B) Data Structure Selection
---------------------------

Search on Github for a merged pull request in a reasonably sized and popular project (>100 stars) which replaces a data structure in order to improve performance.

Examine the use of this data structure, evaluating all the decision criteria discussed in the lecture, and report your findings.
Do these criteria help indicate that the change in data structure would be beneficial?
