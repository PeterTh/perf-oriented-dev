Exercise Sheet 11
=================

This exercise sheet should be worked on **individually**.  
Perform all benchmarks on LCC3.


A) Applying Memoization (optional)
----------------------------------

Apply basic hash-based memoization to `small_samples/delannoy` and benchmark your implementation. 

 * What level of performance improvement can you achieve, both theoretically and practically?  
 * What is the space complexity of your optimized version in terms of the parameters `x` and `y`?


B) Algorithm Tabulation (optional)
----------------------------------

Use dynamic programming tabulation to implement the `delannoy` benchmark while only requiring `O(x)` additional space and no hashing. Benchmark this solution and compare the results to basic hash-based memoization.
